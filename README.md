## Installation
These scripts use the G-Code programming language and environment. Previous experience with G-Code or another programming language is required for efficient use of these scripts.

**Minimal system requirements for using these scripts.** This does not include hard-drive space required for additional software packages or dependencies.

------------------
## Files
The following files are included in this repository:
	* neurons_dumbells_jetCut.txt: A set of G-Code functions to jet-print microfluid-walled dumbbells for culturing of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons with directional connectivity to recapitulate the human corticostriatal connectivity.
	* neurons_dumbell.txt: A script to reconfigure the microfluid-walled dumbbells to model axotomy of human neuronal microcircuit in vitro
